"""Run the G15 PB growth answer and its on-demand backing, actual bodies, against a model.

The harness extracts from drivers/gpu/drm/asahi/g15/pools.rs Firmware::answer_growth(),
answer_request(), map_pb(), refill_backing(), note_idle(), reclaim_check(), free_backing() and
reclaim_delay_ns(), Pools::soft_max(), map_heap(), free_chunks() and back_chunk(), PbChunk,
chunk_gva(), CHUNK_BYTES and Pools::new's PB backing statements; from vm.rs VmState::map_one(),
map_heap(), map_chunk() and unmap_heap_above(); pb_max_blocks() from params.rs, whose
pb_blocks(), pb_reclaim(), pb_idle_ns() and pb_reclaim_blocks() must return the fixed hw.rs tuning
values; the PB sizes, tuning and PB leaf word from hw.rs; Prot::from_pte() and
is_cached_noncoherent() from pgtable.rs; and the g15_pb_max_blocks default from asahi_core.rs.
It includes pools/growth.rs, fw/buffer.rs and fw/channels.rs whole. The bodies run against a model of the firmware objects, the GEM backing allocation, the shared layer's map_at()
and the DEVCTL wait, which logs every allocation, alias map, unmap, free, block record, barrier,
producer store, reply and log line in order. Allocation and alias map failures can be injected.
Source checks: publish_prefix_into() starts with the PB catch-up, and pools.rs asserts the PB leaf
GPU-only at compile time.

What it shows:
- a poll pass answers only the requests queued when it starts, in order; one the reply's wait
  queues goes to the next pass. A request that cannot be processed does not end the pass;
- from the driver's initial size to its maximum, every block record is written once at its
  offset, each producer store follows its records and a barrier, each reply follows its producer
  store and a barrier, and every producer is in 1..=4095, ending at 4095;
- at the maximum two refusals are answered; further requests get no reply, count as bad and
  warn once until the ledger is reset, as init() does;
- the soft maximum is the parameter clamped to 64..=4095 and then to the ledger's
  initial..=max; growth answers above it are logged at info level, and the one that reaches it
  exactly is not;
- invalid requests (type, slot, stale counter, epoch, no live render) get no reply, and requests
  rejected so allocate nothing;
- the backing: the chunks of the initial posting and one reserve chunk when the GPU starts;
  chunks of 16 MiB, backed after the replies of a pass (never between them) while fewer than a
  reserve chunk remain, mapped into the VM of the flights before any record or producer names
  their blocks, never past the heap; with the reserve dry a request waits at the head of the
  queue, keeps its counter and is answered once a chunk is backed; a chunk that cannot be mapped
  into the running VM is dropped again; a pending re-initialization backs nothing while no
  render is published, and still backs for a render published before it; a failed reply keeps
  everything;
- a VM's aliases are the chunks, contiguous from the heap's start; a VM that runs after another
  grew the backing maps it first (at publication); a partial catch-up keeps the aliases made; a
  chunk freed and backed again (an idle reclaim) is unmapped and mapped again at publication;
- the one-VM rule: a catch-up with a flight of another VM is refused (EPROTO) before anything
  is mapped;
- the idle reclaim, actual reclaim_check(), free_backing() and note_idle() over a clock: a heavy
  client that exits with nothing rendered after it is re-initialized after 50 ms with the backing
  kept, and the kept backing is freed after the long idle, its posted count kept until the InitBM;
  at reclaim level 1 the backing stays; a recovery's pending re-initialization frees nothing;
  driven as the idle poll work arms it (reclaim_delay_ns()), the same exit wakes at 50 ms and at
  the long idle and arms nothing after; an idle reclaim arms nothing once its re-initialization
  is pending;
- nothing grown since the initialization (an initial posting above half the maximum, or a
  reclaim floor below it): no re-initialization and nothing armed;
- the actual reclaim keeps the posted count until the next render's InitBM (a model of the
  publication: map_pb() first, then for a render prefix with a re-initialization pending the
  ledger reset of Pools::init()): the same client rendering again after 60 ms re-posts the
  initial blocks and grows again from the kept backing with nothing allocated; after 1.1 s it
  grows again over freshly backed chunks, each mapped before it is posted; a compute-only
  submission between the reclaim and the InitBM maps, backs and posts nothing;
- a reclaim whose walk of the VMs fails counts nothing freed; the VM's next publication drops
  its stale aliases and releases the pages;
- the ledger reset of Pools::init() re-posts from the backing without allocating;
- the PB leaf decodes as GPU-only, not cached-noncoherent: dropping an alias is a plain unmap;
- Ledger::new() is Ledger::new() as of dba2a110de00 (the carried upstream constructor), capped at
  4095, over every growth and fixed input in 0..=4200 and at the u32 extremes. The driver's
  values are unchanged.

Not shown: kernel, firmware or GPU execution, timing, or what the firmware does with a reply, a
refusal or an unanswered request. The model's VMs have no open/closed state: that a closed VM
whose jobs still run keeps its aliases comes from the VM lifetime source (Job and VmJobGuard
hold the VM), not from these tests. The ledger reset is not a recovery. The shared layer's
mapping is modelled, not run.

With --mutations, each mutation below must fail its intended test with the expected message, and
the control (a driver maximum of the whole 4096-block heap) must pass, held by the ledger's cap.
A run that hangs (60 s) counts as no test failed.
