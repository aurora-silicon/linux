# Aurora SEP userspace integration

These files connect the Apple SEP kernel driver to the shared APFS xART
gigalocker and the desktop fingerprint stack.

See [M1-SUPPORT.md](M1-SUPPORT.md) for the T8103 firmware requirements,
reboot-persistent enrollment fixes, reference-key recovery caveats and current
validation boundaries. The historical bring-up results below describe the
individual builds at the time they were tested.

Install the driver service:

```sh
install -Dm755 load-driver /usr/local/sbin/aurora-sep-load
install -Dm644 aurora-sep.service /etc/systemd/system/aurora-sep.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable aurora-sep.service
```

The loader waits up to 120 s for the enclave to seal and unseal a trusted key,
then up to 60 s for `/dev/sep-bio`, and logs how long each took. On J700 the
enclave's key store arrives around 43 s after boot. To change a wait, set
`AURORA_SEP_READY_TIMEOUT` or `AURORA_SEP_DEVICE_TIMEOUT` in whole seconds,
for example with `systemctl edit aurora-sep.service`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=AURORA_SEP_READY_TIMEOUT=180
```

`xart_writes=0` remains the default. `load-driver` explicitly opts into writes
and must only be enabled on a machine whose APFS `.gl` extent passes the
driver's narrow ownership checks: one physical extent, no snapshots or revert
state, and a single extent reference owned by the `.gl` inode. The kernel
resolves that extent from checksum-validated APFS metadata; unsupported layouts
fail closed. The opt-in has been tested on m2 with identity-keybag provisioning,
trusted-key seal/unseal, and reboot reload. The raw iBoot container hash did not
change in those tests, so an actual xART write was **not** validated. Do not
infer that all SEP or Touch ID operations work with a read-only GigaLocker.
Read `XART-SAFETY.md` before enabling writes on another dual-boot machine.

For read-only structural diagnostics on Linux, run
`sudo python3 apfs-xart-inspect.py /dev/disk/by-partlabel/iBootSystemContainer`.
The inspector checks APFS metadata checksums, resolves the latest complete
checkpoint's xART `.gl` file extent, and compares it with the legacy root-record
heuristic. It prints physical addresses and record metadata, not payloads.
It currently supports only a single-node object map and file-system tree and
cannot authorize raw writes. Apple's APFS reference is the format authority:
https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-file-system/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf.
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` runs a synthetic regression case:
when the first live root moves to slot 10, the legacy heuristic chooses a
window shifted 90 APFS blocks beyond the actual `.gl` extent. This proves the
locator can misidentify the extent; it does not identify the historical cause
of any particular damaged container.

For fingerprint support, install libfprint with the aurora driver, then the
fprintd device policy below. The userspace driver is maintained in
https://github.com/aurora-silicon/aurora-sep-userspace (libfprint with the
aurora driver, as source and as distribution packages); this tree carries only
the kernel driver, its loader and its service. The driver behaviour fprintd
sees:

The Aurora driver now reports stage progress only when the kernel's stage
number increases; guidance and stage-zero events are not captured samples.
fprintd 1.94.5 itself emits an initial `enroll-stage-passed` after its
duplicate check, **before** starting enrollment. That first line does not
prove a finger was captured.
A capture the enclave cannot use is reported as a retry, both while enrolling
and while matching: fprintd shows `enroll-retry-scan` or `verify-retry-scan`,
and starts a match again by itself. When the kernel ends an enrolment because
too many captures in a row were unusable (`SEP_BIO_STATUS_REJECTED`), the
enrolment fails with that reason in fprintd's log, and fprintd reports
`enroll-unknown-error`. Kernels from before these statuses never send them.
The device-specific `apple/mesa_calibration.bin` on m2 was recovered using
the bundled [`extract-mesa-calibration.py`](extract-mesa-calibration.py), copied
from [Gist revision `eb079a8007985d04e75182f20994f1a1c496f12e`](https://gist.github.com/DjDeveloperr/867a1961b861c570442724f48f770158/eb079a8007985d04e75182f20994f1a1c496f12e),
which scans the local iBoot System Container read-only for an FSCl/CALB record
with an IM4M manifest. It checks the container structure and markers, **not**
the manifest's cryptographic signature. Keep this blob private to the machine;
it is not a generic firmware package. On m2, a premature master
`SAVE_CATACOMB` returned SEP status `0x6` while its component state was `0x3`
(no save-pending bit). The
`m2fix10` fresh-context gate skips that unavailable save, and bounded
enrollment attempts reached the physical-finger wait without an immediate
enclave error. With the later UUID-forwarding stage2, a physical enrollment
completed on m2fix15 and master/user Catacombs were saved, but on each tested
reboot SEP listed zero live identities despite the host index still listing
the finger. m2fix16–m2fix20 narrowed this to the user Catacomb load: it
returns `0x8002` and becomes active, but reveals zero identities even with
the SCRD credential and sensor/device view prepared first. The saved files
remain backed up root-only on m2. A bounded repeated load still listed zero
identities. An opt-in owner export then produced a durable owner file, but
loading it did not recover the old user identity. `m2fix23` is a separate,
boot-tested candidate that saves owner in the fresh context and user before
master at completion; it has not been finger- or reboot-persistence-tested.
Login must stay password-based until a live post-reboot identity and
successful match are independently verified.

On each Linux machine, extract its own calibration from its local iBoot System
Container (the input partition is discovered automatically):

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0755 /usr/lib/firmware/apple
sudo python3 tools/aurora-sep/extract-mesa-calibration.py \
  -o /usr/lib/firmware/apple/mesa_calibration.bin
```

The extractor reads the iBoot partition but never writes to it. It creates the
output mode `0600`, rejects input/output aliases, and refuses ambiguous or
malformed calibration candidates. Do not commit or copy the resulting blob to
another machine.

Once the hardware path is verified, install libfprint and then the fprintd
device policy:

```sh
install -Dm644 fprintd-aurora.conf \
    /etc/systemd/system/fprintd.service.d/aurora.conf
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart fprintd.service
```

On Omarchy, run `omarchy-apply-lock` once after enrollment. The Quickshell
lock screen then selects `omarchy-lock-fingerprint` automatically and accepts
Touch ID through fprintd. Hyprlock's separate fingerprint switch is not used
by the Quickshell lock screen.

## Packages

`packaging/` builds `aurora-sep`, with the loader, its service and the fprintd
policy, as a distribution package. libfprint with the aurora driver comes from
https://github.com/aurora-silicon/aurora-sep-userspace; install both. Installing
`aurora-sep` lets fprintd load the driver with xART writes on, as above.

On Fedora, `packaging/fedora/build.sh` builds `aurora-sep`. It installs build
dependencies, so run it in a throwaway container from the top of this tree:

```sh
mkdir rpms
podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/src:ro,z -v "$PWD/rpms":/out:z \
    registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:45 \
    /src/tools/aurora-sep/packaging/fedora/build.sh /out
sudo dnf install rpms/aurora-sep-1-*.noarch.rpm
```

On Arch Linux and Arch Linux ARM, build `aurora-sep`:

```sh
cd tools/aurora-sep/packaging/arch/aurora-sep && makepkg -si
```

fprintd starts the loader the first time it runs. Loading the driver at boot
instead has the enclave ready before the login screen asks for a fingerprint.
The Fedora package enables that with a systemd preset when it is first
installed; on Arch, enable it yourself:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable aurora-sep.service
```

The driver attaches to the enclave once per boot, so reboot rather than
restarting the service or reloading `apple_sep`. To move from the manual
install above, remove `/usr/local/sbin/aurora-sep-load`,
`/etc/systemd/system/aurora-sep.service`,
`/etc/systemd/system/fprintd.service.d/aurora.conf` and any drop-in that points
fprintd at another libfprint, then run `systemctl daemon-reload` and
`systemctl reenable aurora-sep.service`. To go back to the distribution's
libfprint, remove `aurora-sep` and run `dnf distro-sync libfprint` or
`pacman -S libfprint`.

## Desktop integration

The first open of `/dev/sep-bio` activates Touch ID: the driver restores the
enrolled fingerprints from the enclave before the open returns, which takes
a few seconds. `aurora-sep-ready.service`, which `aurora-sep.service` pulls
in, makes that open at boot, before fprintd starts. The lock screen, sudo
and polkit then find the reader and the fingerprints ready, and the first
fingerprint request does not wait for the restore. A failed open is only
logged. The packages install it; by hand:

```sh
install -Dm755 aurora-sep-ready /usr/local/sbin/aurora-sep-ready
install -Dm644 aurora-sep-ready.service /etc/systemd/system/aurora-sep-ready.service
systemctl daemon-reload
```

fprintd exits after 30 s without a client, and each new start probes the
reader again, while the login and lock screens ask for the reader as they
come up. `fprintd-no-timeout.conf.in` keeps it running so that it answers
them at once. The packages fill in where the distribution keeps fprintd; by
hand, with `/usr/lib/fprintd` on Arch:

```sh
sed 's|@FPRINTD@|/usr/libexec/fprintd|' fprintd-no-timeout.conf.in \
    >/etc/systemd/system/fprintd.service.d/aurora-sep-no-timeout.conf
```

The Touch ID sensor is the power button. A touch to authenticate goes to the
enclave and never reaches logind as a key press, but a press does, and logind
cannot tell a press meant for the sensor from one meant for the button. Its
default is to power off. `logind-aurora-sep.conf` makes a short press
suspend instead, so pressing while authenticating loses nothing and the next
press wakes the machine, and holding the button for 5 s powers off cleanly.
GNOME sessions and the GDM login screen handle a short press themselves
(`power-button-action`, `suspend` by default); the setting covers consoles
and other desktops. It takes effect at the next boot. By hand:

```sh
install -Dm644 logind-aurora-sep.conf /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/aurora-sep.conf
```

GNOME Shell 51 offers fingerprint only on the lock screen, never on the
login screen, and `org.gnome.login-screen enable-fingerprint-authentication`
(true by default) cannot change that: the greeter connects its fingerprint
reader only when it re-authenticates a running session. That is GNOME's
choice, because a fingerprint cannot unlock the login keyring: after a
fingerprint login, the first application that wants a stored secret asks
for the password. `aurora-sep-greeter-fingerprint.service` lifts the
restriction for those who want it. At boot it copies the one greeter source
file that holds the check out of the installed GNOME Shell, drops the check,
and serves the copy to the login screen's shell alone through a GResource
overlay. When the check is not exactly as expected, for example after a
GNOME update, it changes nothing. The enable key above still applies.

The login screen asks fprintd for the reader once, as it comes up, so the
same unit also holds it back until `aurora-sep-ready.service` has finished:
a few seconds on a healthy boot, but as long as the enclave takes when it is
slow, up to 90 s after boot. Without fingerprint at the login screen that
wait buys nothing, which is why both are one switch, off by default. It
needs `gresource` from glib2-devel. With the packages, or after installing
it by hand, turn it on with `systemctl enable`:

```sh
install -Dm755 aurora-sep-greeter-fingerprint /usr/local/sbin/aurora-sep-greeter-fingerprint
install -Dm644 aurora-sep-greeter-fingerprint.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable aurora-sep-greeter-fingerprint.service
```

Disabling it and rebooting returns the login screen to GNOME's behaviour.

## Biometric userspace header

The canonical ioctl ABI is `include/uapi/linux/apple-sep.h`. Export this
checkout's headers with `make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=<directory>`
and add that directory's `include` to the libfprint build include path. The
aurora driver in aurora-sep-userspace uses `<linux/apple-sep.h>` directly; it
has no copied ABI header. Interface version, ioctl numbers and fixed-width layouts are unchanged.
