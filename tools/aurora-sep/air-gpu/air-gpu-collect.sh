#   ARMED-NO-LOG         the last arming's boot left no kernel log (most likely a hang in the GPU
#                        start, before the journal was written); no older boot's result is shown
#   ARMED-NOT-STARTED    armed, but the driver stopped before it started the firmware
#   FW-BOOT-FAILED       the firmware was started but did not come up
#   DRIVER-REFUSED       the firmware came up, but the driver did not publish the InitData
#   PUBLISH-FAILED       the InitData publish message could not be sent to the firmware
#   DEVICE-CONTROL-FAILED a device-control message was not acknowledged after the publish (the
#                        firmware's control channel, not the InitData contents)
#   INITDATA-REJECTED    the firmware did not acknowledge the published InitData, or crashed on it
#   FW-RUNNING           the firmware accepted the InitData and runs; no GPU job ran
#   FW-CHECK-FAILED      the firmware accepted the InitData, then a post-boot control or check
#                        failed
#   FW-CRASHED           the firmware ran, then crashed or faulted
#   CAP-VIOLATED         after a job the firmware reported a performance state above the cap
#   JOB-NOT-DISPATCHED   a GPU job was never dispatched: the kernel read its GPU start timestamp as 0
#   JOB-FAILED           a GPU job failed: dispatched or not unknown, or dispatched and not completed
#                        (stuck, killed, timed out, faulted, wrong results)
#   JOB-NO-RESULT        a GPU job started but no result was recorded (the boot ended first, or
#                        it is still running)
#   JOB-COMPLETED        air-gpu-job.sh ran, and every submission completed with correct results
#   UNKNOWN              a kernel verdict this script does not recognise
#
# The line also names the source that decided it: the command line, the arming record, the
# kernel's verdict line, the kernel log's structure, or the job evidence. Job evidence comes from
# two sources read the same way in every pass: the air-gpu-job record files and the journal's
# air-gpu-job lines for that boot. A record left at result=running whose journal line has the
# result is judged by the journal, so the same boot gets the same verdict before and after a
# hard reset.

# ---- the verdict table: the kernel log lines each step is judged by --------------------------
# Keep this in step with the kernel's T8122 start experiment (drivers/gpu/drm/asahi/t8122_start.rs).
#
# 1. The kernel's own verdict lines, on an armed T8122 ("M3 G15G verdict: <label>"), and the
#    verdict each label gives. The match is on the label up to the first ':' or '('. Each label
#    has a rank, and the highest-ranked label present decides; among equal ranks the later line
#    wins. So a cap violation outranks everything (it is the fanless safety signal), a job
#    outcome outranks a firmware one, and any failure outranks job-completed and
#    firmware-running.
#    JOB-NOT-DISPATCHED is kept for the two labels the kernel logs only when the job's GPU start
#    timestamp is 0 (an unreadable one, "timestamp None", gives JOB-FAILED); a job the kernel saw
#    dispatched (job-ran-completion-missed) is never JOB-NOT-DISPATCHED. A
#    firmware-running-check-failed line that says the firmware crashed gives FW-CRASHED.
