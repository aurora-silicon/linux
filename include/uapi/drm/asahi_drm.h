/**
 * DOC: Introduction to the Asahi UAPI
 *
 * This documentation describes the Asahi IOCTLs.
 *
 * Just a few generic rules about the data passed to the Asahi IOCTLs (cribbed
 * from Panthor):
 *
 * - Structures must be aligned on 64-bit/8-byte. If the object is not
 *   naturally aligned, a padding field must be added.
 * - Fields must be explicitly aligned to their natural type alignment with
 *   pad[0..N] fields.
 * - All padding fields will be checked by the driver to make sure they are
 *   zeroed.
 * - Flags can be added, but not removed/replaced.
 * - New fields can be added to the main structures (the structures
 *   directly passed to the ioctl). Those fields can be added at the end of
 *   the structure, or replace existing padding fields. Any new field being
 *   added must preserve the behavior that existed before those fields were
 *   added when a value of zero is passed.
 * - New fields can be added to indirect objects (objects pointed by the
 *   main structure), iff those objects are passed a size to reflect the
 *   size known by the userspace driver (see
 *   drm_asahi_cmd_header::size).
 * - If the kernel driver is too old to know some fields, those will be
 *   ignored if zero, and otherwise rejected (and so will be zero on output).
 * - If userspace is too old to know some fields, those will be zeroed
 *   (input) before the structure is parsed by the kernel driver.
 * - Each new flag/field addition must come with a driver version update so
 *   the userspace driver doesn't have to guess which flags are supported.
 * - Structures should not contain unions, as this would defeat the
 *   extensibility of such structures.
 * - IOCTLs can't be removed or replaced. New IOCTL IDs should be placed
 *   at the end of the drm_asahi_ioctl_id enum.
 */

	 * longer one to the maximum the system allows, and returns the
	 * allowance in effect here; a request of 0 is returned unchanged.

	 *

	 *   counted from one poll before the first poll that finds the command
	 *   at the head of the queue. That is no earlier than the command got
	 *   there and may be later: commands submitted to the queue in the
	 *   meantime postpone that poll.
	 * - Once the allowance has passed, the deferrals the watchdog grants
	 *   any command still apply, as they do by default: a command it takes
	 *   to be waiting behind other clients' work, or one of a kind it
	 *   gives extra polls, runs on until those are used up as well.
	 *
	 * The allowance is per command, and nothing bounds the sum: a queue
	 * that is kept full of long commands occupies the GPU for as long as
	 * it is fed. The driver does not shield the other clients from such a
	 * queue: they share the GPU with it as the firmware schedules them,
	 * and a command of another client may have to wait until a long
	 * command ends. The watchdog does not fail such a waiting command,
	 * render or compute, while the earlier command it waits behind runs
	 * inside its allowance; afterwards the usual deferrals apply. A
	 * waiting command is excused this way for at most the longest
	 * allowance the system permits in total, so a command that keeps
	 * waiting behind other clients' work longer than that and its own
	 * deferrals is still failed. Userspace should ask for an allowance
