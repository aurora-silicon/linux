//! `/dev/sep-key`: P-256 keys created inside the SEP.
//!
//! Each key is an enclave ref-key bound to this SEP and to the Linux identity
//! key bag. Its private half never leaves the enclave; userspace holds only a
//! key handle, the wrapped ref-key record behind a small versioned header.
//! A handle works on the Mac that created it and nowhere else. Signing takes a
//! 32-byte digest and returns a DER `ECDSA-Sig-Value`.
//!
//! A key made with `CREATE_BIOMETRY_CURRENT_SET` carries an access-control
//! list in its record, the one macOS gives a Secure Enclave key made with
//! `.biometryCurrentSet`: signing (and key agreement) needs a credential
//! context in which the enclave itself saw a match of one of the fingers
//! enrolled now. The kernel opens that context inside the `SIGN` call, runs a
//! Touch ID match in it, signs, and deletes it before the call returns. No
//! handle to it ever reaches userspace, and every signature needs its own
//! touch. The enclave refuses the signature for any other context; the
//! header's flag only tells the kernel to ask for the touch.
//!
//! `CREATE_BIOMETRY_ANY` is macOS's `.biometryAny`: the same list without
//! the enrolled-set hash, so any finger enrolled in this catacomb matches,
//! including fingers enrolled after the key was made.
//!
//! Interface version 3 adds three calls. `CANCEL` ends a touch-gated call
//! that is waiting for a finger (it returns `ECANCELED`). `SEAL` encrypts up
//! to 64 bytes to a biometric key's public point (ECIES, done here: it needs
//! no private key and no touch). `UNSEAL` has the enclave do the key exchange
//! (`ock`) of such a blob's ephemeral point with the key, under the same
//! fresh, touch-satisfied credential context as a `SIGN`, and finishes the
//! AES-GCM decrypt in the kernel, as macOS does for Secure Enclave keys: the
//! key's access-control list constrains the key exchange as it does the
//! signature, so a sealed secret is released only after a match the enclave
//! saw. Userspace uses it for secrets that must not exist outside the
//! enclave without the user (FIDO hmac-secret).
//!
//! Interface version 4 adds keys under a user's own key bag (linux#921;
//! variant-5 key store, `INFO.features` `FEATURE_PASSWORD`). `CREATE_USER`
//! makes a `.userPresence` key under `uid`'s bag, or with flags 0 a key with
//! no list that works only while the bag is unlocked; the enclave refuses
//! either while the bag is locked. `SIGN` / `UNSEAL` on a user-presence key
//! wait for a Touch ID match as for a biometric key; `SIGN_PASSWORD` /
//! `UNSEAL_PASSWORD` hand the bag's password to the enclave instead
//! (`VERIFY_SECRET` into a fresh context), which checks it and counts a
//! wrong one before the one operation runs. Root or the bag's own user may
//! make these calls. `CREATE`'s own `CREATE_USER_PRESENCE` bit stays
//! reserved: under the identity bag the only passcode is the identity bag's
//! secret, which root holds.
//!
//! macOS's `.userPresence` (Touch ID or the password) and `.devicePasscode`
//! need a passcode credential the enclave checks against the user's own
//! secret. On Linux the only passcode the enclave knows today is the identity
//! key bag's secret, which root holds, so those policies would be
//! root-satisfiable. Their `CREATE` bits are reserved and refused with
//! `EOPNOTSUPP` until a per-user, password-keyed bag exists; they are never
//! emulated in software.
