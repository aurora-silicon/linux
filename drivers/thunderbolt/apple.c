 * Apple Silicon USB4 and Thunderbolt driver
 * Copyright (c) Sven Peter <sven@kernel.org>
 *
 * This driver implements the Host Router / ACIO coprocessor as well as the
 * Native Host Interface (NHI) as shown in the diagram below.
 * The ACIO is a Cortex-M3 coprocessor which handles the Thunderbolt
 * protocol and exposes its own hardware blocks like the USB4 Native Host
 * Interface (NHI) and its IOMMU to the main SoC bus. The entire block
 * can only be brought up after the unified Type-C PHY has been initialized
 * to Thunderbolt or USB4 mode and needs an out-of-band notification from
 * the Type-C PD driver.

 * ACIO and ATCPHY have strict ordering requirements. When a USB4/Thunderbolt
 * connection is requested after a device has been connected the Type-C PD
 * driver performs the following sequence:
 *
 * 1) Configure the PHY for the negotiated mode and orientation through
 *    typec_mux_set()
 * 2) Pass the cable details to this driver through typec_thunderbolt_switch_set()
 * 3) Power up ACIO, boot its RTKit co-processor and apply the tunables
 * 4) Probe the DART and NHI children now that their MMIO is accessible from
 *    the main SoC bus
 * 5) Register the USB4 domain and write the cable details to the host router
 *    which brings up the link and starts discovery
 *
 * The reverse order is required when the cable is disconnected then:
 *
 * 1) typec_thunderbolt_switch_set() removes the USB4 domain and the ACIO
 *    children, shuts down the co-processor and powers everything off.
 * 2) typec_mux_set() puts the PHY into safe mode and powers it off.
 *
 * ACIO must not be started before the PHY is configured and the PHY must
 * remain active until ACIO has been powered down again. The child devices
 * cannot  remain populated while ACIO is powered off because they are part
 * of the ACIO block and only exposed to the main SoC bus and will SError
 * once ACIO is off.
 * Violating this ordering can panic the kernel with an async SError at best
 * and trigger some internal watchdog that will reset the entire SoC at worst.
