//! Evidence-backed T8140/G17P firmware init-data layout.
//!
//! HISTORY / PROVENANCE. The previous revision of this module was derived from
//! the **M5 / G17S** on-disk firmware `GFX.a010.macho` (parser at VA
//! 0xfffffc000002127c) — a different chip and a different firmware build from
//! the target, **A18 Pro / T8140 / G17P**. G17S and G17P share a generation
//! name but not an ABI: every structure size in that model was wrong, the five
//! `+0x254` pointers were modeled as independent allocations instead of views
//! into one bundle, and the M5 magic 0x0c8d_e339_0728_04c0 is rejected by the
//! T8140 firmware with "Host and FW Interface is mismatched". This revision is
//! re-derived from:
//!   - live T8140 hardware runs (Mac17,5 / J700 / T8140), which booted both
//!     firmware instances with a source-constructed descriptor;
//!   - our own J700 firmware image: the version-word gate is the MOVZ/MOVK
//!     chain at `__TEXT+0x1e8a8` (`mov x10,#0x4c0; movk #0x396,lsl 16;
//!     movk #0xa322,lsl 32; movk #0xc8a,lsl 48`), and the same routine
//!     confirms the endpoint-0x20 doorbell contract
//!     (`(msg & 0xbf<<48) == 0x81<<48`, address rebuilt as
//!     `msg | 0xfffff0_0000_0000_0000`);
//!   - the executable serializers in the m1n1 tree
//!     (`proxyclient/m1n1/agx/g17p.py`, `g17p_initdata.py`) and
//!     `docs/t8140-g17p-firmware-abi-spec.md`, both validated by byte-exact
//!     rebuilds of pre-handoff captures.
//!
//! The object graph: each firmware instance is handed one root (`0xb8` bytes
//! for the primary, `0xc8` for the secondary). The root carries the version
//! tuple, the full UAT geometry (page size, level count, and three 0x20-byte
//! level descriptors), and points at a per-instance main configuration
//! (`0x600`), the shared region A (16 KiB), the shared region C (`0x1000`),
//! and per-instance status blocks. The main configuration points at the shared
//! hardware-data object (`0x3db4`, at the base of a contiguous bundle
//! allocation of at least `0x10000`) and carries a 17-entry channel table.
//! The five bare pointers at main `+0x254` are views into that one bundle;
//! allocating them independently breaks the overlap and offset relations
//! firmware relies on.
//!
//! Byte slices are used instead of packed Rust structures because several
//! proven fields are unaligned (main `+0x254`, main `+0x471`, and the region
//! record address at `+0x0c`).

//   110.0 C and sensor mask 0xaa0 when accel[0x4a0] == 0x1f, else 0x82a.  It
//   zeroes the per-sensor array for each mask bit.  It panics ("Not all MTR
//   Sensors required for FastDie are enabled") only when the host MTR-enable word
//   accel[0xe978] is non-zero and lacks a required bit.
// - The base populate (0x883d41c) takes optional ADT gpu-fast-die0-sensor-mask64/
//   -sensor-mask/-target (default 101.0 C, overridden above).  setupConfig reads
//   the optional gpu-fast-die0-release-temp/-prop-tgt-delta/-proportional-gain/
//   -integral-gain and gpu-fastdie-mrc-period.  The J700 ADT carries none of
//   them.
// - initPowerAndPerformanceData copies the staged values into
//   - the GFX1 power object: `[[fw+0x2d8]+0x6678]`; GFX1 reaches it through
//     secondary main +0x471 = bundle view 2 + 0xe40;
//   - the 0x6a8-byte secondary-root +0xb8 object (`fw+0xcd8`), which Linux

// - When the +0xb8 object's +0xc4 flag is set, GFX1 copies its +0xc8..+0xe4
//   fields into the power object.  Native updateLifetimeServoTempTarget and
//   updateFastDieController set that flag after writing the fields.
// - GFX1 takes the lower of that target and an external target, then programs
//   each masked MTR sensor's threshold registers (stride 0x200, +0x1000/+0x1004/
//   +0x1014) at (target - delta) / 100 C.
