 * The platform driver has independent frontend and backend DAIs with the

 * driver configures the routing based on DPCM couplings in ASoC runtime
 * structures, which in turn are determined from DAPM paths by ASoC. But the
 * platform driver doesn't supply relevant DAPM paths and leaves that up for
 * the machine driver to fill in. The filled-in virtual topology can be
 * anything as long as any backend isn't connected to more than one frontend
 * at any given time. (The limitation is due to the unsupported case of
 * reparenting of live BEs.)

/*
 * Speaker protection ownership: "Speaker Protection", a protection engine
 * in the signal path. It owns the speakers only while it is the interface
 * ("Speaker Protection Interface", see macaudio_spk_iface_put()); under
 * "Speaker Volume Unlock" an owner may hold the control, but nothing is
 * granted and its locks and releases touch no amp.
 *
 * While leased, the speakers play only while a protection engine owns them. Without an
 * owner, or once its lease has run out, every speaker amp sits at the safe
 * level and no speaker playback can start: that is the hardware floor, and it
 * holds from the card's registration on.
 *
 * The owner is the control file that holds SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_LOCK on
 * "Speaker Protection", taken by a CAP_SYS_ADMIN process: the speakers are
 * not a seat user's to own. Writing a lease length in milliseconds
 * (SPEAKER_LEASE_MIN_MS to SPEAKER_LEASE_MAX_MS) to it grants protection
 * for that long: the amps go to their fixed operating gain and speaker
 * playback may start. The owner renews it by writing again before it runs
 * out; every write needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN too. Writing 0, unlocking the control
 * or closing the file ends it at once: no start from then on, and on amps
 * with a digital gain the stream still playing is ramped down within the
 * lease (at most SPEAKER_RAMP_MAX_US) before it stops, so that the stop
 * does not click.
 *
 * The amps are only written on a powered card: a withdrawal while the card
 * suspends or resumes (the owner dying at thaw) closes the gate and stops
 * the streams at once and waits for the resume to finish before it puts
 * the amps at the safe level. The ownership controls are INACTIVE, so that
 * alsactl's restore never writes them.
 *
 * A lease that runs out closes the start gate at its end, from a hard
 * hrtimer that no thread can delay, and every start checks the lease's end
 * itself as well. Two SCHED_FIFO workers then stop speaker playback and put
 * the amps at the safe level. The owner's next write fails with -ETIMEDOUT
 * and grants nothing, so an owner that stalled learns of it before it plays
 * again; so does an owner that was frozen across a system sleep. Reads
 * return 1 while protection is granted, 0 otherwise, and every change is
 * notified.
 *
 * On machines that open the tweeters' playback high-pass while granted, a
 * grant opens it only for an owner that has declared, on the boolean
 * "Speaker Protection Crossover", that its engine passes every speaker
 * channel through the machine's own crossover and high-pass ahead of the
 * amps. Without that declaration the tweeters stay at their safe corner
 * while granted. The owner writes it with CAP_SYS_ADMIN, through its own
 * ELEM_LOCK on that control (taken while it owns "Speaker Protection"),
 * and only while protection is not granted: a grant latches it, and a
 * write meanwhile fails with -EBUSY. Any other write fails with -EPERM.
 * The declaration goes back to 0 when the owner unlocks "Speaker
 * Protection" or closes its file, and when a new owner takes it.
 *
 * The speaker volume controls belong to the driver: userspace can read them
 * but never write them. While protection is granted they hold the amps at a
 * fixed, known gain; all attenuation is the engine's, in its signal path.
